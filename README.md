# icecreamrandomizer
This is an iOS application that helps you select what to order when visiting an ice cream shop.

- The first view shows a UIPicker that contains various ice cream flavors and mix-ins.

- Tapping the "Randomize" button will choose a combination for you at random.

- Tapping either the "+" or "-" buttons will increase or decrease the number of mixins to be randomized.

- Tapping the "favorite" button will add the current combination to your list of favorites.

- Tapping "Settings" in the top-right will take you to the settings page where you can customize how the randomization works.

- The slider allows you to change how frequently the randomizer selects an option from your favorites.

- The "Edit Favorites" button allows you to view and remove the combinations that have already been favorited (by swiping left).

- The "Ice Creams and Mixins" button allows you to select the ice creams and mixins that will be displayed in the UIPicker.
